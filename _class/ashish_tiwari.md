**Hello, You!**

Whether or not I love coffee, I'm most certain that means nothing to you. Antarctica is Melting! No, I'm gonna say about myself too. Here we go... 

I was born at an early age, spent some time growing up (presumably) and went to learn stuff at school. I love to explore new things (not a single so far though). I enjoy good markup, strive for good styling and am passionate about the beautiful code.

By the way, I use social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook. If you want to know more about me, head over to my [notes](http://notes.aashishtiwari.com.np) or [drop me a line](mailto:hi@aashishtiwari.com.np) (I like annoying people, yeah!). It would be mine pleasure to hear from you. ;)

Moreover,

* I'm demigod with an iron. Ironing in of more creases than were there to start with is a field I expertise in (If you happen to think of acquiring this skill, contact me!).

* I play and watch football. I don't know a thing of Basketball (It's not only).

* I believe in Last Song Syndrome(LSS). I'm Sick until I get Sick!

That's it about me. I've had enough now, I'm sure you have as well, so why not go somewhere [else](https://justinjackson.ca/words.html).

And thanks for being here. :)
