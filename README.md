# Class of 2020 Website 



The site is open source (here's all the code!).

Submit [issues](https://github.com/Classof2020/classof2020.github.io/issues/new) and [pull requests](https://github.com/Classof2020/classof2020.github.io/compare/) for stories, site ideas or copy edits.

### Goals

- Demystify open source terminology
- Showcase the class members to promote connections and sharing between individuals.
- Make getting started with GitHub easier

### Under the Hood

This site is made with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), an open source static site generator. This means the Jekyll program takes the content we want to be on the site and turns them into HTML files ready to be hosted somewhere. Awesomely, GitHub provides free web hosting for repositories, called [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/), and that's how this site is hosted.
